> There is no great genius without a mixture of madness

Welcome to my dojo!
I love thinking, engineering [reverse engineering in some cases] and coming up with simple and innovative solutions for complex problem. I love exploring tech and algorithmic development at various levels of abstraction. Besides tech I love watching movies, reading up on finance, IB and asset managemen
